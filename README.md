Welcome to Wobble Wobble Wonder! A "find the object" game with the character Dingle from Dave and Bambi: Golden Apple!

This game is for my friend Ashton for his 16th B-Day! He has autism and can't learn anything higher from a 1st grade level. So, I decided to make this for him and anyone else who would like to play it! Enjoy!
